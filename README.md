# Project - Tic Tac Toe

> The purpose of this project is to consolidate the acquired knowledge of the Ruby programming language. For this, we decided to develop a Video Game development project called Tic Tac Toe, in order to learn the correct operation of Object Oriented Programming.

This web page was the third Ruby Programming Language Project of the Microverse curriculum.
In this project, we learned the importance of Object Oriented Programming in programming languages and how Ruby can help us accomplish this task.

- [Unzip](http://www.e7z.org/open-zip.htm) the repository or just clone it using git or github.
- Grab the main.rb file and open it on your favorite online code editor, for example [repl.it.](https://replit.com/)
- If you want to see the source code of the files located in my repository, you can do it through a [code editor of your choice](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/best-code-editors), I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), first, you must [install it by following these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), then you must [open the folder containing my repository in your local repository](https://thisdavej.com/right-click-on-windows-folder-and-open-with-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20navigate%20to,with%20VS%20Code%E2%80%9D%20as%20well.) and [open each of the files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see their content.
- If you have any questions or problems about how to run this project, you can leave me a comment in the [issues section](https://github.com/aristides1000/tic_tac_toe_project/issues) of this repository, I am more than willing to help you.
